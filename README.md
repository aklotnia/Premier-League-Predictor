## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

If you want to run this project on your computer, it is necessary to get api keys for a variety of different soccer and new apis. You will need an api key for the guardian api, as well as for the football-data api and the api-football-v1 api. The guardian key can be generated by making an account on https://open-platform.theguardian.com/. Keys for the other two apis can be generated through the use of rapid-api. After obtaining these keys, you can fork and clone the repository. git clone git@github.com:aklotnia/Premier-League-Predictor.git is the command necessary to clone from the master without forking. If you fork, the repository clone command will be different.

### Installing

If you don't have ruby or a ruby version manager installed on your system, it will be necessary to install the ruby version specified in the gemfile which is 2.6.1. Additionally, you will need to install the bundler gem for ruby. You will also need to install node.js. Once node is installed, you can install npm, or node package manager. Once npm and ruby are both installed, you should be able to run rails server and npm install/start in the respective javascript and ruby directories.

In one terminal:

```
git clone git@github.com:aklotnia/Premier-League-Predictor.git
cd Premier-League-Predictor
cd football-api-postgres
bundle install
rails s
```
In another terminal:

```
cd Premier-League-Predictor
cd football-frontend
npm install
npm start
```
The rails server needs to run on port 3000 and react can run on any port in order for the fetch requests to work.
